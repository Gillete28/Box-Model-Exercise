# Box-Model-Exercise
The box model is made up of the content, padding, border, and margin of an element. Within CSS, the following properties apply: display, padding, border, margin, box-sizing. 
For all properties of the box model to apply to an element, that element must either be set to display: block or display:inline-block. 
Box-sizing is possibly the most difficult concept of the box-model to understand.
Content-box - The total width of the element only includes the content.
Border-box - The total width of the element includes the content, padding, and border.
